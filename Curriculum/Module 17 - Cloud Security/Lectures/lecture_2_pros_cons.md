# Comparison of Server Types: Cloud, Dedicated, and Shared Servers

## Introduction

In the realm of web hosting and server management, selecting the right type of server is crucial for the performance, security, and scalability of your applications and websites. This document compares three popular types of servers: cloud, dedicated, and shared servers, highlighting their pros and cons.

## Cloud Servers

Cloud Server: You pay for a service to scale your application
Dedicated Server: A single server for a application (not scalable)
Shared Server: A single server hosting multiple applications/projects
