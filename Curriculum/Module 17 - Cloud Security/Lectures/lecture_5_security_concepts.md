   - *Customer Responsibility:* Secure and update operating systems, middleware, and runtime environments within their virtual machines or containers.

1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**

   - *CSP Responsibility:* Provide tools for identity management, authentication, and access control.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Manage user access, permissions, and authentication processes for applications and data.

1. **Data Security:**

   - *CSP Responsibility:* Ensure security and durability of underlying storage infrastructure.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Encrypt sensitive data, set access controls, and manage data retention policies.

1. **Applications and Endpoints:**

   - *CSP Responsibility:* Offer a secure platform for hosting applications and may provide security features.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Develop, secure, and monitor applications, as well as ensure endpoint security.
