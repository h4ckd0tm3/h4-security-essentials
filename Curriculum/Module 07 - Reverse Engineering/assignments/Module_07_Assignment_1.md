## Assignment: Reverse Engineering a simple keygen checker

### Objective:

This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of the reverse engineering process of native binaries.

### Instructions:

1. **Analysis:**

   - Analyze the given binary and figure out how it works

1. **Generate a valid keygen:**

   - Your username is the first letter of your first name and your last name appended, without any special characters. Every character shall be lowercased.

   Example: Max Mustermann => mmustermann

   - Upon a valid key, the program will print: "You win".

### Submission Guidelines:

1. **Report with key:**
   - Submit a short writeup of what the program does, your username as stated above and the valid key for your username.
   - The report should be in PDF format
   - Ensure your name, date, and the title of your writeup are included.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Valid key:**

   - Is your key valid for your username?

1. **Report**

   - Did you analyze the program properly and correctly state all steps it does within the report?

By completing this assignment, you will gain a richer understanding of the reverse engineering of a simple native binary.

### Bonus Points Task: Debugger Usage or Program Patching

#### Objective:
For bonus points, demonstrate your proficiency in using a debugger for reverse engineering or show your skills in patching the binary to bypass the key validation mechanism.

#### Instructions:

1. **Using a Debugger:**
   - Use a debugger to step through the binary and document your observations.
   - Focus on how the binary processes the input and validates the key.
   - Highlight any interesting breakpoints, function calls, or conditional checks.

   **Or**

2. **Patching the Binary:**
   - Modify the binary to bypass the key validation process.
   - Ensure that any input results in the program printing "You win".
   - Document the patching process, explaining the changes made to the binary.

3. **Enhanced Report Submission:**
   - Include a section in your report titled "Bonus Points Task: Debugger or Patching".
   - Detail your approach, whether using a debugger or patching, and describe your findings or the steps you took.
   - Include screenshots or code snippets as necessary to illustrate your process.

### Additional Submission Guidelines for Bonus Points:

- Add this bonus task as a separate section in your report.
- Clearly label this section for easy identification by evaluators.

### Evaluation Criteria for Bonus Points:

1. **Effectiveness of Technique:**
   - Successful use of a debugger to trace key validation or successful patching of the binary.
   - Accuracy and clarity in explaining the debugging or patching process.

2. **Quality of Documentation:**
   - Depth of detail in documenting the steps taken and findings.
   - Clarity and relevance of screenshots or code snippets used.

By completing this bonus task, you will showcase advanced skills in reverse engineering, either through the analytical use of a debugger or the practical application of binary patching, both critical competencies in cybersecurity and software analysis.
