## Assignment: Reverse Engineering a simple keygen checker

### Objective:

This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of the reverse engineering process of native binaries.

### Instructions:

1. **Analysis:**

   - Analyze the given binary and figure out how it works

1. **Generate a valid keygen:**

   - Your username is the first letter of your first name and your last name appended, without any special characters. Every character shall be lowercased.

   Example: Max Mustermann => mmustermann

   - Upon a valid key, the program will print: "You win".

### Submission Guidelines:

1. **Report with key:**
   - Submit a short writeup of what the program does, your username as stated above and the valid key for your username.
   - The report does not need to be in pdf format, a simple markdown file is enough.
   - Ensure your name, date, and the title of your writeup are included.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Valid key:**

   - Is your key valid for your username?

1. **Report**

   - Did you analyze the program properly and correctly state all steps it does within the report?

By completing this assignment, you will gain a richer understanding of the reverse engineering of a simple native binary.
