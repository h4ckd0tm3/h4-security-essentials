# Penetration Testing

This module will introduce students to the practice of penetration testing, a critical component of offensive security. Students will learn about the penetration testing process, from initial scoping and reconnaissance, to vulnerability assessment and exploitation, to post-exploitation and reporting.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the penetration testing process and its importance in IT security
- Use common penetration testing tools and techniques, such as vulnerability scanners, exploitation frameworks, and post-exploitation toolkits
- Conduct a penetration test against a target system or network
- Write clear and comprehensive penetration test reports that accurately communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders

## Topics Covered

1. Introduction to Penetration Testing
1. Scoping and Reconnaissance
1. Vulnerability Assessment
1. Exploitation and Post-Exploitation
1. Reporting

In addition, students will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with penetration testing tools and techniques through the HackTheBox platform, and will hear from a real-world penetration tester about their experiences in the field.

By the end of this module, students should have a solid understanding of the penetration testing process and be able to conduct basic penetration tests against target systems or networks.
