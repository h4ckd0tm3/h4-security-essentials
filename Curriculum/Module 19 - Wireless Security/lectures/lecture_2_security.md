# 2. WiFi Security Fundamentals

## 2.1 Introduction

In our digital age, WiFi networks are ubiquitous, serving as the gateway to the internet for both personal and professional use. However, this convenience also brings vulnerability. This lecture aims to guide you through the essential steps and best practices to secure your WiFi network effectively.

## 2.2 Security Risks

- **Unauthorized Access:** Unauthorized access occurs when individuals who are not authorized to use a WiFi network gain access to it.
- **Data Theft:** Data theft refers to the unauthorized retrieval of data transmitted over the network. It can be particularly damaging if sensitive information is intercepted.
- **Network Attacks:** Network attacks disrupt the normal functioning of a network, steal data, or damage network infrastructure.
- **Malware Infiltration:** Malware infiltration refers to the introduction of malicious software into the network.

**Note:** This lecture is only required to provide a basic understanding and brief overview of WiFi security fundamentals. Detailed security risks and attack vectors are covered in later lectures.

## 2.3 Security Protocols

The first line of defense in securing a WiFi network involves choosing the right security protocol. These protocols are responsible for authentication (controlling the access to the network) and encryption (securing the integrity and confidentiality of data) in the network.

- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** Outdated and highly insecure, avoid using.
- **WPA (WiFi Protected Access):** Better than WEP, but has vulnerabilities.
- **WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2):** Currently the most secure option available for most users.
- **WPA3:** The latest standard, offering improved security features.

## 2.4 Further Considerations

- **Strong Passwords:** Use a complex password for your WiFi network by mixing letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid common words or easily guessable information.
- **Change SSID Names:** Change the default SSID to something unique but not personally identifiable. Avoid names that make the network a more likely target for hackers.
- **Disable WPS:** WPS can be a security vulnerability due to its PIN feature making it easier for devices to connect. Disable WPS to prevent potential brute-force attacks.
- **Firewalls:** Activate the router’s built-in firewall to add an extra layer of defense. Consider additional firewall software for more comprehensive protection.
- **Firmware Updates:** Regularly update the router’s firmware to patch security vulnerabilities. Set reminders or enable auto-updates if available.
- **MAC Filters:** Use MAC address filtering for an additional layer of security. Be aware that MAC addresses can be spoofed by determined attackers.
- **Reduced Range:** Adjust the signal strength of your router to limit coverage outside your premises. Consider the physical placement of the router in your home or office.
- **Guest Access:** Create a separate guest network if your router supports it. Ensure it has a different password and doesn’t provide access to the main network.
- **Monitoring:** Regularly check the list of devices connected to your network. Investigate unknown devices or unusual activity.
- **Education:** Educate yourself and employees about the risks and threats affecting wireless security. Only then it is possible to deal with threats.

## 2.3 Conclusion

Securing a WiFi network is a critical task in safeguarding your digital life. By implementing these practices, you significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and protect sensitive information. Regular vigilance and adherence to these security measures will help ensure that your network remains a safe gateway to the digital world.
