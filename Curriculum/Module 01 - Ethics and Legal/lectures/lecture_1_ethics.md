# Hacker Ethics

### Definition

Hacker ethics is a set of principles that guide the behavior and decision-making of ethical hackers or those involved in the IT security community. These principles stress the importance of sharing information, maintaining integrity, and avoiding malicious intent.

### Key Principles

- **Information should be free:** Knowledge and information are seen as universal goods, and their distribution should be encouraged.
- **Access to computers should be unlimited and total:** Exploration and experimentation are vital to learning and innovation.
- **Promote decentralization:** Centralized systems can become single points of failure or control, making decentralization more resilient.
- **Judge by skills, not by formal credentials:** Recognize merit and talent over formal education or titles.
- **You can create art and beauty on a computer:** Computers can be a medium for creativity, not just utility.
- **Computers can change your life for the better:** Embracing technology can lead to positive societal changes.

## Ethical Dilemmas

While ethical guidelines provide a general roadmap, real-life situations often pose dilemmas that can't be easily resolved. Some of these might include:

- **Responsibility when discovering vulnerabilities:** Should one disclose the vulnerability immediately, notify the entity at risk first, or keep it private?
- **Balancing privacy and security:** At what point does monitoring become surveillance? How do we balance the need for security against individual rights to privacy?
- **Engaging in "gray hat" activities:** Sometimes actions may lie between clearly ethical (white hat) and clearly malicious (black hat). How does one navigate these gray areas?
