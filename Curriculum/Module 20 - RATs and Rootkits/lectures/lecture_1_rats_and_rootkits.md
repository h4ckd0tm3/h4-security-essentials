Explain what RATs and Rootkits are and how they work:

**What is a RAT:**

"A RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is malware an attacker uses to gain full administrative privileges and remote control of a target computer. RATs are often downloaded along with seemingly legitimate user-requested programs -- such as video games -- or are sent to their target as an email attachment via a [phishing](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/phishing) email".

"Once the host system is compromised, intruders use a [backdoor](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/back-door) to control the host, or they may distribute RATs to other vulnerable computers and establish a [botnet](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/botnet)".

(Yasar 2022)

**How is it working:**

RATs can be deployed through a framework like Metasploit, the Hacker compromises an open port on the target computer over which the Hacker gets a connection to the target PC.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/9C6Pvq9wSrhaP-BytOUXIKvXc9o6JE_L75oHslnWX9rU2RHirTwz6Zcnhj_9oTcajEpUwBsySqWUWQhmk7fjLtzBRQKFM-wTXH-0Na-cBBq4GKrU24LQFBx9-KE0of4PkAdZAF6vchWciAICxqYS7Q4)

RATs can also be installed over phishing mails, "legit" software or torrent files. Sometimes RATs get installed after the hackers get first initial access.

(see Yasar 2022)

**What is a Rootkit?**

Is a Malware that is designed to give the threat actor control over a computer network or application. Once the malware is activated it sets up a backdoor exploit which could come with additional malware such as:

-   ransomware, bots, keyloggers or trojans.

"Rootkits can stay undetected for up to several years."

**Rootkit example: Spicy hot pot**

Spicy Hot Pot malware uploads users' memory dumps and adds a local update feature. To enhance stealth, it introduces two kernel-mode drivers during infection, a step beyond typical browser hijackers.

These malicious drivers perform functions that can:

-   Intercept and modify user input and output requests

-   Enable the malicious actor to update the malware any way they wish\

Describe the common features and functionalities of RATs:

Because a RAT provides a backdoor and enables administrative control, it empowers the intruder to do almost anything on the targeted computer, including the following:

-   Monitor user behavior, such as keystrokes, through [keyloggers](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/keylogger) and spyware.

-   Access confidential information, such as credit card and Social Security numbers.

-   Activate a system's webcam and record video.

-   Take screenshots.

-   Distribute viruses and malware, as well as launch [ransomware](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/ransomware)

-   Format drives.

-   Delete, download or alter files and file systems.

(see Yasar 2022)

So generally it can be said that RATs are designed to give the User complete control over the victim's computer. Things like the activation of webcams or Keyloggers are part of Spyware, although the manipulation of files makes it a potential Ransomware. Because of all these facts it's obvious that RATs have a wide variety of potential use cases.

**Describe the common features and functionalities of Rootkits:**

-   Privilege Escalation:

-   Rootkits aim to escalate their privileges to gain the highest level of access on a system, such as root or administrator privileges.

-   By doing so, they can control all aspects of the operating system and compromise the security of the entire system.

-   Persistence:

-   Rootkits are persistent, meaning they are designed to survive system reboots and remain active on the compromised system.

-   They often use techniques like modifying system files or registry entries to ensure that they are loaded during the system startup.

-   Backdoor Functionality:

-   Rootkits frequently include backdoor functionality, allowing remote attackers to access the compromised system without being detected.

-   This backdoor access can be used for various malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, launching attacks, or turning the compromised system into a part of a botnet.

-   This may involve hiding files and processes, manipulating system logs, or using rootkit-specific mechanisms to conceal their activities.

-   User-mode Rootkits:

-   Other rootkits operate in user mode, making them less powerful but also less detectable.

-   User-mode rootkits may achieve their goals by modifying user-level processes and system libraries.

-   Anti-Antivirus Techniques:

-   Rootkits often include mechanisms to evade detection by antivirus and security software.

-   This may involve actively monitoring and responding to security software scans or manipulating system components to avoid detection.

**Analyze real-world RAT attacks and identify the techniques used by attackers**

"In 2014, the Hacking Team, an Italian cybersecurity firm, fell victim to a RAT attack themselves. The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in their systems and stole sensitive data, including client information and zero-day exploits. This incident served as a stark reminder that even those tasked with defending against cyber threats are not immune from being targeted". (Sankaran, 2023)

This is a perfect example of how difficult it can be for even a specialized company to avoid a vulnerability in its infrastructure.

The next example is in connection with NotPetya, one of the most terrifying Ransomware attacks in history.

NotPetya was built up with different components, of which one took advantage of a vulnerability in the SMB protocol, called EternalBlue or CVE-2017-0144(see Positive Technologies, 2021). Because of the EternalBlue vulnerability, NotPetya could spread so immensely fast and infected thousands of computers. Even 6 years later, in 2023, EternalBlue is still used for security lessons, to show a pretty easy way to compromise a computer and gain full access to it.

"Another notable example is the case of Blackshades RAT. In 2014, law enforcement agencies across the globe conducted a joint operation to dismantle the Blackshades network. This remote administration tool was used by hackers worldwide to perform various illegal activities, such as spying on victims through their webcams and stealing personal information". 

(Sankaran, 2023)

To conclude all these examples, it should be clear how damaging RATs can be for normal users and even more for companies.

**Analyze real-world Rootkit attacks and identify the techniques used by attackers**

Some of these real rootkit attacks summed up:

**ZeroAccess (or ZeroAccess Rootkit):**

-   ZeroAccess is a sophisticated rootkit that primarily functions as a click-fraud and Bitcoin mining botnet. It often spreads through drive-by downloads and social engineering techniques. Its complexity and ability to avoid detection have made it a significant threat.

**Hit Kit:**

-   As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, "HitKit" doesn't refer to a well-known rootkit or malware. It's possible that it's a new term or a specific reference within a certain context.

**Ebury:**

-   Ebury is not a rootkit but rather a sophisticated backdoor Trojan designed for Linux servers. It is used by attackers to gain unauthorized access and control over Linux systems.

**Flame:**

-   Flame, also known as Flamer or sKyWIper, is a highly complex and sophisticated cyber espionage malware that targeted primarily Middle Eastern countries. It had various capabilities, including data theft, audio recording, and taking screenshots.

**Necurs:**

-   Necurs is not a rootkit but a notorious botnet that has been involved in various cybercriminal activities, including spam email campaigns, distributing ransomware, and participating in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

**Implement and use tools to detect and defend against RATs**

It can be pretty difficult to defend against RATs, because of the fact that they can often operate completely in the background processes of the computer. Even though it can be hard to detect them, there are several ways to do that:

-   One of the most common ways to defend against RATs is Anti-Malware Software. The software scans the PC to search for known RATs and removes them. The efficiency of this process is determined by the antivirus software used and its database of known RATS.

-   A way more complex tool is an IDS(Intrusion Detection System). An IDS scans the network traffic for suspicious activities and sends out an alert if something was found. RATs need to get a connection with the victim's PC, this connection process can be detected via an IDS. An IDS is harder to implement, but for beginners Snort could be a good tool to start with.

-   Another powerful tool is a FIM(File Integrity Monitoring). This solution validates the integrity of a given environment, namely, it checks to see whether the contents of your site's files have changed unexpectedly. With FIM it's hard for a malware to change something on the file system, because the files are continuously checked on their integrity, especially the critical system files. (see Robert Abela , 2023)

So it can be said that there are tools to defend against RATs. It's also important to update software on the computer, as well as informing on recently discovered vulnerabilities. Most RATs get installed by pressing on suspicious links in mails, so having a healthy skepticism is important.

**Implement and use tools to detect and defend against Rootkits**

To counter rootkit malware, organizations  should implement advanced endpoint protection solutions using technologies like artificial intelligence, telemetry, and real-time response capabilities. These solutions go beyond traditional measures and include continuous monitoring of endpoint BIOS to prevent kernel rootkit attacks.
