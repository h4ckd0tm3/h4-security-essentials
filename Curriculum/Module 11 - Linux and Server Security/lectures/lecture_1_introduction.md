# Introduction Linux Security

The second a device is visible to the outside word, with that I mean it gains access to the internet, it becomes a target for bad-actors. A insecure, unhardened server is a mere playground for people who want access to your data, or use the server in any other way they please.

Without good security measurements a server can be compromised, be part of a DDoS attack and the owner wouldn't even know. Securing a server doesn't start with installing uncountable anti-virus programs but with the choice of the OS.
