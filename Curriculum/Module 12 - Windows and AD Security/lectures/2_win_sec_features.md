### Windows Event Logs
Windows Event Logs are a crucial component of the Windows operating system's logging and monitoring infrastructure. They provide a detailed record of system, security, and application events on a Windows device. Event Logs play a crucial role in troubleshooting, monitoring, and understanding the activities and status of a Windows system.

Event Log Types:
- Windows has three main types of event logs: System, Security, and Application.
- Each log type captures specific types of events related to system, security, and application activities.

System Event Log:
- The System Event Log records events related to the Windows operating system and hardware components.
- Examples include system startup, driver issues, and hardware failures.

Security Event Log:
- The Security Event Log logs security-related events, including logon attempts, user privilege changes, and security policy modifications.
- It is a valuable source for monitoring and investigating security incidents.

Application Event Log:
- The Application Event Log captures events generated by applications, services, and programs.
- Errors, warnings, and informational messages related to application activities are logged here.

Forwarded Events Log:
- Forwarded Events is a special event log that collects events forwarded from other computers.
- It is commonly used for centralized event log management in a network environment.

Setup Event Log:
- The Setup Event Log records events related to the installation and configuration of software and Windows components.

Event IDs:
- Each event in the logs is assigned a unique Event ID, helping to identify the nature of the event.
- Event IDs are associated with specific types of events, errors, or warnings.

Event Levels:
- Events are classified into different levels: Information, Warning, Error, and Critical.
- These levels indicate the severity of the event, with critical events representing the most severe issues.

Event Source:
- The Event Source identifies the application or system component that generated the event.
- It helps pinpoint the origin of events for troubleshooting purposes.

Event Log Size and Retention:
- Each event log has a maximum size, and older events are overwritten as the log reaches capacity.
- Administrators can configure log settings, including maximum log size and retention policies.

Event Log Subscriptions:
- Windows allows for event log subscriptions, enabling the forwarding of events from one computer to another for centralized monitoring.

Windows PowerShell Integration:
- PowerShell commands, such as Get-EventLog and Get-WinEvent, allow users to query and filter events from the command line.

Event Viewer:
- Event Viewer is the graphical user interface tool for viewing and managing event logs.
- It provides a convenient way to filter, search, and analyze events.

Event Log Filtering and Searching:
- Event Viewer allows users to filter events based on various criteria, such as date, event level, source, and keywords.
- Searching capabilities help locate specific events or patterns in the logs.

Event Log Subcategories:
- Some events have subcategories that provide additional information about the nature of the event.
- Subcategories help in further categorizing and understanding events.

Event Log Forwarding:
- Windows supports event log forwarding, allowing organizations to centralize event logs for analysis and monitoring using tools like Windows Event Collector (WEC).

Custom Event Logs:
- Administrators can create custom event logs for specific applications or services to capture events tailored to their needs.

Security Auditing:
- Windows Event Logs are a crucial component of security auditing, helping organizations meet compliance requirements and monitor security-related activities.
