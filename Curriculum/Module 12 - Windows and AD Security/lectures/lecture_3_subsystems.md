- *LM Hash*: A legacy, easily crackable password storage format, emphasizing the need for more secure alternatives.
- *NTLM Hash*: More secure than LM, but still vulnerable to certain attacks, necessitating additional protective measures.
- *Kerberos*: The current standard, utilizing ticket-based authentication, offering improved security through its advanced authentication process.
