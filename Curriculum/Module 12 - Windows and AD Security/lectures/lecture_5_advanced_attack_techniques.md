## Advanced Attack Techniques

### Exploiting Kerberos

As we delve into the intricacies of Active Directory security, understanding advanced attack techniques targeting the Kerberos authentication protocol is paramount. This section explores the exploitation of Kerberos, shedding light on potent threats and techniques.

#### *Golden Tickets:*
- Forged TGTs with Extensive Access Rights: Golden Tickets are clandestinely forged Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) that, once in the possession of an attacker, grant extensive access rights across the entire Active Directory. This represents a severe threat, as it allows an attacker to persistently and surreptitiously navigate the AD environment.

#### *Silver Tickets:*
- Forged Service Tickets for Covert Access: Silver Tickets provide attackers with a more covert alternative. These forged Service Tickets grant access to specific services within the network. While less conspicuous than Golden Tickets, Silver Tickets enable attackers to target specific resources without attracting undue attention.

#### *Kerberoasting:*
- Extracting Service Account Credentials: Kerberoasting is a sophisticated technique that involves extracting service account credentials from the Active Directory environment. Attackers target service accounts and exploit vulnerabilities, allowing them to retrieve the credentials and potentially compromise sensitive information.
